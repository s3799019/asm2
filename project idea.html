<h2>Project Idea</h2>
<h3><b>1. Motivation and How does it work?</b>
</h3>
<p>
The Covid-19 pandemic has radically changed the world. It changed our daily life and brought social, economic, and environment change. As everyone knows, we should be cautious of close human-to-human contact and be careful when touching public objects such as handles or elevator buttons to avoid infection. Also, we should manage our personal hygiene such as wearing a mask and washing hands frequently. Besides, there should also be an application that collects data of students' travel history, as well as the people who they have interacted with in order for the university to know and permit students to go to the campus.</p>
<p>
Firstly, we will have to create a system that assists us in collecting the information of students(which type of data has already been mentioned above). Then, we will need an application and a website for the students to fill in any of their personal information, after that the system will begin to analyze the data of that student. Once the system has done with analyzing the data, we will share the data for the university to decide whether to permit that student to come to the campus or not based on the data that we have gathered.
Secondly, to reduce human resource used in checking body temperature and students’ IDs, we will replace them with an advanced and well programmed entrance that scans their IDs, body temperature and contrast with the data that the campus has collected to decide if that student is allowed to get into the campus or not. The entrance would also have a remote hand sanitizer for students to use everytime they have completed all the steps mentioned above.</p>
<p>
Hand sanitizers will be placed at the entrance, nearby each and every elevator, and outside of the canteen areas in RMIT. Using autonomous hand sanitizers will reduce the risks or transmission because physical touch oftentimes would leave the pathogen/virus on the surface.</p>

<h3><b>2. Details (Tools and Techonologies)</b></h3>
    <p>With this concept, we believe that using Arduino technology will help reduce the components of this machine a lot. In detail, we will be using the DHT11 temperature sensor and PS/2 barcode scanner arduinos. Both two of these sensors are easy to use and pretty cheap. Once the students scan their student IDs with the barcode at the back of the card, their information will be checked with the online platform to see if he or she is allowed to go inside the campus. Then, that student will be asked to place his or her hand in the hand sanitizer spot. To this point, the machine will use the temperature sensor to check that student’s body temperature to double check with the online information then will give out an amount of hand sanitizer to clean that student’s hands. On the other hand, the online platform will share and use an app called “Blue zone” source code through github. The platform will save the data from the RMIT’s students once they fill it online. Then, the school principal will determine if the student is allowed to go to school or not. If the student is allowed, he or she will need to go to school and follow the steps above.
    </p>
<h3><b>3. Benefits and Comparison </b>
</h3>
<p>
This project aims towards the safeness for the students as we all want to have a safe study environment. With the technologies the university will be able to ensure that no students will have to be worried about risks of getting infected on campuses. Moreover, if any student has contacted the person who has positive results for COVID-19, its data will help either a university or the government manage appropriately and efficiently. Since many scenarios do not have any symptom at the beginning, it is challenging to manage citizens’ data without  technologies. Not to mention, the autonomous hand sanitizers will help in keeping the students’ hands clean. It has also become a positive habit for all students to stay alert at this time.</p>
 <p>There are a great deal of impediments for world development based on Cheatsheet article , 5 problems (energy storage, AI-Artificial intelligence, space exploration, water scarcity and food production)  should be solved as soon as possible, but why AI (Artificial Intelligence) is the most important owing to COVID-19. Some people claimed that it is a short-term situation which is not as dangerous as the others, because they could live in safer countries. For instance, in the United States, it is over 800,000 deaths of its total population. It is such a terrible figure that the pandemic causes briefly. Hence, if we just think it causes a minority, how many deaths will ease around the world in the future ? </p>

 <h3><b>4. Disadvantages and Possible solutions</b></h3>
<p>In order to acquire and analyze even most-needed details in the students’ travel history, and the people they have interacted with lately it is inevitable that this will make the students have the feelings of their personal lives being stalked. But worry not, the system will only track your location, and the other people who have been with you recently, and the data is only known between the university and the government so that they would know whether you have the potential of carrying the virus within you or not first before the university can decide if they should let you come to the campus. In trying times like this, it is not easy to make students feel safe and attend classes often because there is always the sensation of worrying about getting infected by the new virus within each and every student. Which is why we will need to have stricter policies like this to ensure the students have a safe and clean study environment.</p>
