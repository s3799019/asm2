<h2>Group Reflection</h2>
</body>
<h3>Trang:</h3>
<p>Group project is an enticing part that students can engage at a university that is less in national environments as Vietnamese public schools. This combines many necessary soft skills for students to have experience before taking part in real life. The more composition the group is, the higher production is. Individuals will contribute their own ideas to one project and create critical outcomes. Some characteristics you can realize after working as a team. I felt happy I had a group on the first day of this course and we kept in touch with each other well. Until week 6, we had conducted Assignment 2, some situations got more complicated during working time. We did not have any extra appointments outside classes, but we contacted via messengers to discuss together. 
Working as a team is a big challenge project, but working with a team in different majors is so difficult that I felt in some moments. Fortunately, my teammates are kind and good-tempered to affiliate with me and support me when I was confused. I can recognize the out-standing personality of each member and the strength they are. Also, I can improve my IT knowledge thanks to my teammates ideas. </p>

<p>All the team members are friendly and sociable, so during group meetings for this project it always went smoothly and it was also easy to get along with everyone. Each and every team member also completed the assigned tasks on time. Everything pretty much went well, except for that one time it was so hard for us to reach out to Thinh which has infuriated Tae so i had to join in the conversation to appease and lessen the heat. It was just because of the lack of communication which had led this to happen, if it is something that could have been improved it would be everyone participated in every group discussion so they are always caught up to what the group has talked about. Despite the lack of communication which had taken us quite some extra time to reach out to each other in the team we still managed to get everything done on time which was very surprising for me. If it's one thing that I have always found interesting about working as a group is that I get to interact with different people from time to time, I love to communicate and get to know more about anyone I work with, as well as getting along with everyone. As time passes by I learn and find it easier to adjust myself to work with different people so we would have a similar work flow and also have a friendly work environment. </p>

<p>The high level of work efficiency was a great help to do the assignment. Each member finished the work that was given to each in a short time and utilized their knowledge and resources properly in order to complete the task. We collaborated efficiently so that we can complete the task in a timely manner. but I felt a little bit of a lack of communication between each team member. The work as a team would proceed without a hitch or be much easier if the communication went smoothly.
 A surprising thing during the team project was that eventually everything was done and finished even if initializing the group assignment like who takes which part was not that easy at first. Each member worked together and got through the assignment.
 I learned how to cooperate with other team members.I could obtain communication skills through the process.I think working in a team is enormously different from working alone. I have been experiencing many team projects or team assignments through the study at schools but I had a pressure about the first team assignment in the university. However, it was getting easier to interact and communicate with other team members.</p>
<h3>Thinh:</h3>
<p>- The group project is really a big challenge for anyone in our group. But, in the end, I think things have been going on the right track, especially that each member’s ideas have been examined carefully but not biased. Personally, things that could have been improved are myself who did not attend that many group meetings. One thing that makes me really surprised is Trang gave out a very brilliant name at the near end of our time. And I have learned many things from being a member of the group, such as, we need a lot of communication to function a group well, and each member has to be diligent and honest to the group’s work. In the end, everyone's work showed how much effort that they put into and I believe that we all learned something from each other and doing this project, for ourselves and for our careers.

<h3>Group:</h3>
<p>To collaborate and to push and commit freely in GitHub repository, we used the method that invited the collaborator. Because we estimated that no need to grant any permission of one member is much more accessible. By inviting each team member to allow the access to the one certain repository, we could push and pull the outcome at each member’s local repository. Everyone could check the contributions of each member in the github repository recorded at Insights section.
To say about the meeting, we had face to face meetings after the tutorial class every Wednesday. We formed our group in Week 5 and had 4 meetings from week 5 to week 9 after the class except week 7. We proceeded with the meeting for at least 20 minutes and in each meeting, we discussed and framed the plan. The regular meeting was also the chance to check if the plan progressed satisfactorily and if there is any problem or concerns.</p>
<li>1st meeting (Week 5, 30 minutes) - Established the overall plan and proposed the framework. The IT Work part which required the contact with an IT professional and help of him/her was discussed as a high priority.</li>
<li>2nd meeting (Week 6, 20 minutes) - Create the github repository (But a new repository was made at week 7 due to the continuous error we could not resolve.), Divided 4 of the area in the IT Technologies section who is going to take charge of which area. </li>
<li>3rd meeting (Week 8, 25 minutes) - Developed the Project Idea which was determined in the virtual meeting. Organization and arrangement about the Interview that was conducted in the previous week.</li>
<li>4th meeting (Week 9, 20 minutes) - Checked every part which should have been written. Discussed about Feedback and Group Reflection part.</li>
<p>Except that regular face to face meeting, the detailed things and concrete ideas such as team name, project idea, and further information about Industry Data were decided via virtual meeting in facebook group chat or discord in real time. We brainstormed each part that needed the whole member’s idea. Specific determination in Team Profile(compare and contrast the ideal jobs) and Tools section also decided through the online meeting during 5 weeks of time.
About the HTML and CSS, every 4 members contribute to HTML and one member took charge of CSS. Each member pushes and commits their own part to the one common repository.</p>
