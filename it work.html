<h2>IT Work</h2>
<p>&nbspUnfortunately, a face-to-face interview was not available because the IT professional we interviewed is living in HaNoi right now. Hence, we conducted the interview via skype. Below are the interview contents.</p>
<p>&nbspFirst of all, thank you very much for agreeing to the interview and spend your time with us. We truly appreciate the opportunity presented. Your responses will be used as input to our assignment report. We are going to ask the same question we sent you before so please feel free to answer and ask if you do not understand.
</p>
<h4>1. Could you tell us about your IT work? What exactly do you do?</h4>
<p>I am currently working in a company called Mobifone. I work in the algorithm data science department. I do algorithm research. Analyzing and designing IT systems is also my work.
</p>
<h4>2. Please tell us about the industry you work in.</h4><p>Telecommunication industry which delivers telephone, Internet, and other services to customers throughout the country.</p>
<h4>3. What other kinds of work do you have to do?
</h4><p>I am in charge of the IT system. And I assign the specific works to everyone in the team because I work as a project manager.</p>
<h4>4. Who are all the different people you interact within your work? Please tell us about them.</h4><p>I work with my boss, colleague, and cooperator. The cooperators are employees of Ericsson* and Nokia. They sell equipment for machines and 5G. And I work with some cooperators from a subway company. And having interaction with some software and IoT system companies. They support some stages of projects. We talk and work with cooperators from other provinces or other countries via the internet. </p>
<p><small>*Ericsson:  Swedish multinational networking and telecommunications company which is the oldest telecommunication company in existence.</small>
</p>
<h4>5.  Could you please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals?
</h4><p>When I begin work on a new project, I need to meet customers or vendors to ask them about more and more precise and detailed things that we need to do. If I could get enough information, I analyze them and design a plan. After the plan is set, I propose the plan to my boss. If the plan is approved, I continue to do work with the project.
</p><p>I also need to meet coworkers and cooperators to complete projects. There are many stages and faces in the project. And in each stage, I need to cooperate with some specific person and team.</p>
<h4>6. What about your interactions with clients or investors?
</h4><p>As I mentioned above, I have many interactions with clients and investors, vendors or customers.</p>
<h4>7. What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.</h4><p>It is hard to say the exact answer because it depends on each project. But I think I spend most of my time on solutions for resolving problems. It takes time. When I finish designing a plan, I need to find a solution to do the project. It takes time because we need to test and experience many solutions. And through the process, we finally choose the most suitable solution for our project.
</p>
<h4>8. Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?
</h4><p>I think the most challenging aspect in my work is assigning work to the right person, the right teammate. There are several projects and works going on simultaneously. Therefore, I need to know their strength and their weakness to assign work to them. I need to understand them properly. </p>
<h4>9. What is the most crucial and required skill when you work?</h4><p>Self-study ability is most important. I need to read many various science and technical documents to obtain concrete knowledge. I need to understand the numerous documents and summarize it into my knowledge. I need to apply the knowledge I got from self study into the real work and transfer my knowledge to my teammate. </p><p>So the first thing is self-study, collect information, summarize many technical documents into my knowledge and transfer my knowledge to my teammate. </p>
<h4>10. When you feel satisfaction in your work?
</h4><p>I feel satisfied when I complete a project that brings good value for my organization and many other people. When our application came out as a result, I was very pleased.</p>
<h4>11. Have you ever wanted to give up this job?
</h4><p>I have never wanted to give up this job because it has not been that long since I work. I joined this company about 4 years ago. Therefore, I think I didn’t have enough time or chance to give up. Even now, I think I will not give up. Personally, my PhD program was much harder. I have done a PhD program in Korea and I thought about giving up before when I do it.
</p>
<h4>12. Have you been interested in the IT field since you were young?</h4>
<p>I didn’t have enough information about IT jobs when I was young. I didn't have enough chances to think that I wanted to have a job related to IT or become an ITer before. I got a job in the IT field after I applied to Hanoi University of Science and Technology. But It was kind of an accidental chance.</p>
<h4>13. Do constant technology changes affect your work? (if so, negative way or positive way?)</h4>
<p>I think constant technology changes affect us positively. New technologies allow me to discover many things. My thinking and brainstorming with the team is required to adapt to new technologies. I need to update myself day by day but I think it is good. It helps me in my work so that I can improve my work. It also enables me to apply new technologies to my work. For an easy example, before, the computer had low performance. It cannot solve Ai or big data problems. But now, the computer with high performance allows me to solve complex and sophisticated problems as if AI of Big Data.</p>
<h4>14. Are there times when you feel difficult to adapt to new technologies?</h4>
<p>No, actually there are some times that are a little bit difficult but the problem is time. if I have enough time then I can cope with the problem. I can eventually find a solution by learning a technology. But if we only have a short time, I will have a difficult time to adapt to new technology. So it depends on time.</p>
<h4>15. What kind of things (skills, certifications, etc.) can we prepare as a student before we get a job?</h4>
<p>Programming. Programming languages like C and C ++, team work skills, and independent skills are important. For certification, TOEIC for english skill. And some experiences through internships. Also finding a good mentor who can help to improve. There are many courses and e-books teaching programming languages. So, learn and prepare it step by step.</p>
<h4>16. Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</h4>
<p>Currently I am doing a project for agriculture. We call it smart agriculture for short. We utilize and apply the IoT (Internet of Things) system for agriculture. It can reduce the cost, time, effort and enhance productivity because it improves agriculture and helps farmers easily for harvesting. We use information technology for precise areas. I think this is an example of the essence of the IT industry.  </p>
