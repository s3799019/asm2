     <h2>IT Technologies</h2>
   <ul>
       <li><h3>- Cybersecurity:</h3></li>
       <h4> What does it do? </h4>
       <p>The world is within the interior of a cybersecurity race. With threats from hackers and deceivers throughout the internet presenting an even bigger danger to business, society, and safeness than ever before in history. However, we tend to utilize advanced technologies to strengthen up online security and this is going to be crucial in the later years. </p>
       <p>The threat from cybercriminals is turning into more and more subtle, therefore security has to be able to adapt so as to stay up. As luck would have it, there are a variety of recent technological developments that have helped improve the arsenal at our disposal to confirm we have a tendency to win against cyber attackers. Here are the 5 key technological advancements that are presently doing the foremost to enhance the cybersecurity efforts.</p>
       <p><b>Blockchain</b>: Blockchain isn’t simply the underlying technology that runs Bitcoin. However, is additionally security equipment. The digital ledger permits for the secure sharing of data and identity authentication, while not putting the information in risks of getting exposed to outsiders. This is the reason why there are health services like the NHS within the UK are experimenting with blockchain as a way of keeping the patient’s information from harm and sharing it between facilities.</p>
       <p><b>Cloud technology</b>: Despite being convenient, cloud has been evidenced to be problematic. The amount of data that can be stored on a single cloud account is actually surprising but this also puts the user’s data into possible risks. Luckily, cloud security has created leaps and bounds in recent years, with developers guaranteeing that every data is well protected against hackers more than before. Cloud data consists of a set of policies, controls, procedures, and technologies that collaborate to protect cloud-based systems, data, and infrastructure. These security measures are aligned altogether to protect cloud data, support regulatory compliance and secure customers' privacy as well as setting authentication rules for individual users and devices. From authenticating access to filtering traffic, cloud security has proven to be exactly what businesses want.</p>
       <p><b>IoT technology</b>: One of the major flaws with early-release internet of things technology is that it is connected to multiple devices while missing a common security system. This has led people to have concerns towards home assistant devices such as Alexa could possibly be the gate opener for hackers to access their personal devices. Fortunately, the large corporations have taken notice of the issue and so, IoT software these days will likely have a cybersecurity infrastructure that can be shared with all devices inside a household.</p>
       <p><b>AI and machine learning</b>: Possibly the foremost development that has allowed the U.S. to remain ahead hackers is the advancement of AI and machine learning technology. This technology is capable of gathering data across the globe and use it to adapt to any new kinds of threat. As such, hardware and software packages are getting more intelligent
without the need of human input and are becoming progressively adept at pre-empting security threats and adapting as desired.</p>
       <p><b>Application security</b>: Before, applications on a device were only secured thanks to the device they were hosted on. Hackers quickly took interest in smartphone applications and so, the applications were like a tool for them to use and access the data on our phones. But a lot has changed in recent years, with security software now being an essential part of the app-building process. As such, many apps are now even more secure than the devices they are installed on.</p>
       <p>Not to mention there are 3 technologies that are going to define the next decade of cybersecurity which are: 5G networks and infrastructure convergence; Artificial intelligence; Biometrics. </p>
       <h4> What is the likely impact? </h4>
       <p> As our society grows more reliant on technology, so is the importance of cybersecurity. We may be improving our capabilities to fight against cyber threats with the aid of new technologies, but the hackers could also weaponize the new technologies and use them against us. For example: Artificial intelligence is a double-edged sword that can be used as a security solution or as a weapon by hackers. The AI capabilities used to point out and prevent cyberattacks can also be used by hackers to launch sophisticated cyberattacks in the form of complex and adaptive malware. Hackers can use AI themselves to check and refine their malware so that it can actually become AI-proof. AI-proof malware can be extremely destructive as it can learn from existing AI tools and develop more advanced attacks to penetrate traditional cybersecurity programs or even systems that are boosted by AI. Which means that these AI-Enhanced cyber threats are and will still be posing great threats toward modern organizations. I believe that whoever has their personal information archived on the internet could always become a target, no one is ever really safe as long as they are connected to the net because they will always be spied on and this proves that anyone that’s using the internet is always affected by the development of cybersecurity. Cybersecutiy has an enormous impact on the internet across the globe because it prevents your data being accessed by the anonymous, as well as protecting the documents, materials, any data in companies, etc…. I doubt cybersecurity would make  any current jobs or technologies because it’s a completely different working field, cybersecurity even has to rely and advance certain technologies to improve the protection of data/intel in organizations, governments, and individuals too. Instead, it would create more jobs such as: Cyber Security Engineer; Vulnerability Analyst/ Penetration Tester; Systems Engineer; Network Engineer/ Architect.</p>
       <h4> How will this affect you? </h4>
       <p> From my perspective, cybersecurity has always been affecting our lives starting with the most basic knowledge that is about valuing and protecting our personal information. The lack of awareness about cybersecurity measures is one of the main reasons why people get their accounts on social media hacked, or getting their sensitive information revealed on the internet. It is also the reason why so many organizations suffer data breaches. The shortage of knowledge leads to insecurities which means that there are many breaches, data exposure cases are caused by seemingly innocuous errors that even basic cyber-security training could help mitigate. From the way I see, as the world continues to advance, the same applies to common knowledge. Before there was no internet so there was no reason for cybersecurity to exist or become an essential part of humans’ daily lives. One thing I know for sure is that the technologies which are used in cybersecurity will get more advanced as cyber threats/attacks will be more malicious and sophisticated as time passes by. This means that in the later years there could possibly be even more verification steps and policies just to lessen any possible risks of your data getting accessed by hackers. My take on this is that I’d definitely feel annoyed if I have to go through this much of phases just to protect my personal information on my Google, social media, online game accounts, it is very time consuming and frustrating for me, and then once there are new policies that get applied to the verification steps it would take even more time. I am sure that a lot of people including my family members and my friends would have that feeling of annoyance if they ever have to pass through such a tedious process just to have their data protected. </p>

       <li><h3>- Machine Learning: <h3></li>
         <h4>What does it do?</h4>
           <p>Arthur Lee Samuel who invented the term ‘Machine Learning’ defined machine learning as ‘a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed’ in IBM Journal of Research and Development in 1959. Machine learning is one field that develops the algorithm and technology to let the computer learn in AI(Artificial Intelligent) technology. It analyzes data exploiting algorithms, learns through the analysis, determines the correct answer, and predicts the future trend and changes based on the data of learning. Machine learning utilizes sophisticated algorithms to learn from a great quantity of big data. Its goal is not to put explicit guidelines to the software by coding directly but letting the computer identify and learn an operation performance method itself through a ton of data and algorithms. The thing that makes a machine learn and put the machine to work faster and longer instead of humans enables automation. Hence, Machine learning makes it more affordable and flexible.
           </p><p>There are  6 major fields (Manufacture, Finance, Medical, Marketing, Government, Transportation) that machine learning technology has been applied and could be applied.</p>
           <p><strong>Manufacture:</strong> In the manufacturing and production field, manufacturers collect an enormous amount of data from sensors in factories and IoT(Internet of Things), and it is ideal for machine learning. Computer vision and abnormality detection algorithms are utilized for quality control and machine learning algorithms are used from everything from preventative maintenance and demanding forecasting to new service provision.</p>
           <p><strong>Finance: </strong>Finance which a large amount of data and history records are provided is a suitable industry for machine learning. Machine learning algorithms are utilized in stock trading, loan approval, fraud detection, risk assessment and insurance acquisition. And it also can be used to provide daily consultation to customers and to coordinate portfolios based on the user’s goal.</p>
         <p><strong>Medical: </strong>Machine learning also can be used in the medical field. Machine learning algorithms can process more data and discover more patterns than research teams or doctors, regardless of the time invested. Thanks to wearable devices and sensors that enable real-time identification, the medical industry is becoming a huge stage for machine learning.</p>
         <p><strong>Marketing: </strong>Machine learning can be used for websites recommending products that buyers will like. Utilizing product recommendation and promotion by analyzing the search and purchase history of past purchasers’. Data usage to personalize the shopping experience is becoming a new future in the marketing industry.</p>
         <p><strong>Government: </strong>There are especially many opportunities to acquire insights through machine learning Because government departments in charge of public safety and agencies that provide public services have various data. For example, Machine learning can analyze sensor data to find ways to increase efficiency and reduce costs or to detect fraud and minimize identity theft.</p>
         <p><strong>Transportation: </strong>Even in the transportation industry, which should predict potential problems and deploy routes efficiently to increase profitability, the technology that analyzes data to find patterns and trends is emerging as a key technology. Hence, courier companies, public transportation services, and other transportation companies are using data analysis of machine learning as a critical analytical solution.</p> <p>Machine learning is one field of AI (Artificial Intelligence) and came up with the notion that early AI researchers established. In other words, one method to embody AI is machine learning. AI covers a wide range and in that range, and machine learning takes charge of forecasting. In addition, Data has a big portion of Machine learning technology. It determines the accuracy and performance of AI. Also, big data is a technology that processes large scale data and machine learning is one of the areas that can make good use of big data through finding correlations between the data. In addition, Its practicality is reinforced due to the appearance of deep learning.
         </p>
         <h4>What is the likely impact?</h4><p> Until the decades ago, machine learning had a very limited range in work that machines can replace. But as technology evolved into the 21st century, the range gradually expanded. The level of technological advance has risen immensely and the machine learned through machine learning threatens human jobs in recent years. One of the biggest possible changes that could be done is autonomous driving vehicles. As big data technologies have developed, the amount of data that can be collected has also grown. Based on the data machine learning algorithms will make capable decisions in real-time. The safety and trust of autonomous driving vehicles also increase. Unfortunately, however, it will certainly hit the transport and freight businesses. Besides autonomous driving vehicles, the technology as if curling robots and medical diagnostic systems mostly utilize machine learning as well. These automation technologies have a profound impact on transportation, sport, and medical fields and the industries I mentioned above like finance, manufacture, marketing, medical industry. These new developments are not generalized and pervasive so far but It has been progressing even right now.
         </p><p>Machine learning technology can increase the chances of losing a job but it does not mean that every job and work is supplanted by machine learning technology. It can be interpreted that every worker should have knowledge about machine learning. Many companies and institutions around the world are developing and researching to reduce costs by applying machine learning technology. The person who deals with and processes the data also becomes increasingly an important position in society because they have begun to make their major decisions based on data. Researching new data types of data, and studying how to use the data for jobs in different fields by using machine learning as a means is crucial. As a result, it seems that the data science field will be significantly important as time passes.</p>
         <h4>How will this affect you?</h4><p> Machine learning will have a direct impact on everyone who can be aware of it or not. The dark side of machine learning technology is that, as many jobs will disappear and be replaced, people will have more difficulty when they find the job. In contrast, however, the bright side is it can replace dangerous and reluctant jobs. For instance, robots utilizing machine learning will process hazardous tasks like nuclear waste disposal, bomb disposal quickly and accurately without any control that the human had to do.</p><p> Besides the job, convenience in daily life will be increased in most applications and programs we usually use. For example, recommendation services including advertisements in social media, friend recommendations, would be more precise and accurate. And digital personal assistants also will be smarter. It will handle the schedule, handle the simple tasks as a real assistant. In my case, I am very forgetful. I used to buy the same grocery or food that I already bought and exist at my home. In this case, a digital personal assistant using machine learning technology can automatically check my refrigerator or grocery pantry and order what I need. It enlarges usability.
         </p><p> Last but not least, It will contribute to the overall health care industry including medical image processing, risk analysis, diagnosis, new drug development, and so on. Patients can monitor their health without the help of a professional medical doctor. Waiting in the waiting room for medical treatment is no more required. It will highly increase the accuracy and precision of diagnosis and decrease the time and accidents. Machine learning technology will help a large number of old people and people with disabilities who are not easy to go to the hospital alone largely back up.</p>
         <br>
       <li><h3>- Autonomous vehicles:</h3></li>
<h4>What does it do?</h4><p>The Information Technology (IT) World is a fascinating outcome that many companies or organizations spend a great deal of investment in this industry to evaluate the advanced technologies, especially dynamic traffic systems – anonymous vehicles (AV). According to Vnexpress news, the estimated net sales of the car industry are over 6 billion USD in 2030, and it is around a half and one billion USD for vehicle reidentification development in them. (vnexpress.net, 2018) The automated vehicle has advanced control applications such as radar, lidar, sonar, sensor, GPS, as well as odometry intervened with little or no human interaction. Historically, the initial prototype of the automobile is a radio-controlled car which was invented by Francis Houdina in 1925. But lots of people thought this was a trick at that time, so this invention is not entirely recognized as its value. Constricting fewer than 10 milestones, an autonomous car became a promising vehicle in real-world conditions (digitaltrends.com, 2020). In 2009, Google is known as a pioneer in the Technology Industry launched its Self-Driving Car Project. It seems a dramatic hit in vehicle reidentification, many renowned car companies including BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Ford took part in the enticing and challenging races. The direr the competition occurs, the bigger car manufacturer dives in.
</p><p>
  In the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) definition, there are 6 levels of driving automation, ranging from fully manual to fully automated systems. A level 3 (Conditional Automation) self-driving car is the latest available circumstance in the IT World. If certain conditions are satisfied, the vehicle can drive from one point to another point. Although automakers do not have any plan for sale, driverless cars are allowed for the general public on Ontario roads in Canada within strict conditions and notified by jurisdiction alert (canada.autonews.com, 2019). But most authorities have not embraced this smart version because of unsafe public usage. The reason is it can make informed decisions for itself and manage most safety-critical driving functions, so the users are able to take control of the vehicle during emergencies actively if the vehicle does something inappropriate to ensure pedestrian safety, avoiding unexpected situations. The Audi 8 or Tesla, for example, the car equipped with the technology can be sold yet can not be turned on and used individually. The biggest concern is traffic infrastructure and communication not only in Vietnam but also around the world. Simple put, how an anonymous car can safely navigate the public environment wholefully on their own in either disorganized driving awareness or poor and crumbling aspects of infrastructure such as potholes as well as road signs. The dominant interaction between vehicle and road is clear signs and lane markings that help a vehicle work in direct and right circumstances to follow customers’ destinations. Waymo’s chief automotive officer – Adam Frost said “shares our vision of creating an autonomous future where roads are safer, and transportation is more accessible and greener”.
</p><p>In the future, Level 4 (High Automation), is the most effortful project that the majority of Automotive Vehicle (AV) leaders can not afford at this time. The driverless capabilities of Level 4 that a car can do all the driving in certain situations, but not all the conditions. Not only automatic public driving but also self-driving ridesharing service many companies secretly experiment. Waymo has been ranked as the leader in autonomous vehicle technology by Navigant. The fundraising of Waymo is over $30 billion which is near half of the total market cap of Ford Motor Co ( money.usnews.com, 2020). Besides, Waymo has collaborated with Volve to integrate a robo-taxi which is a new platform of ridesharing services without a steering wheel or pedals. In addition, Numo is a full automation vehicle for delivering groceries instead of carrying people. Feature of the vehicle is it independently ships goods following a user setting without human interaction.</p>

<h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
<p> Practical autonomous vehicles are an ongoing potential innovation which transfer humanization more civil and organized. First and foremost, due to electronic engines, using this vehicle can minimize the hazard and damage not only from energy consumption but also accidents. When a vehicle works, it will follow a selected system from a manufacturer. Therefore, most sceneries such as conflict, congestion, speed limit, appropriate distance as well as disutility are reduced effectively. Mode multi task ability is the next advantage, many people tend to be productive in every moment in their life as a workaholic, so they prefer to do some work or discussions while on a long-distance journey. Many user-vehicle modes engage in different activities while commuting through a table below. </p>
 <p>I agree that an anonymous vehicle will change and ease the human habit more suitably and safely. For instance, Although the user has to concentrate on roads entirely, some people easily pick up a phone while driving. Unfortunately, it is a personal habit but the results other people have to cope with, eventually threaten your life. But the most challenging obstacle is self-adapted perception. If a customer is willing to embrace and chase innovative technologies, the volume of this market will spread out significantly. It will become an alternative version for traditional ones. </p>
   <p>
     Individually, the traffic laws will be changed more complicated because we have to control two versions ( conventional and innovative vehicles) in the same system. More self-driving car consumption when the government promulgate the legislation for a public ridership. Based on the Macromill Embrain survey, different distributions will expose which ages of participants are interested in a new version. A young man from 20 to 29 years old is more acceptable with driving effectiveness than women. It assumed that innovation requires new knowledge and wastes plenty of time, especially the older. They usually think that a new version is too complicated to make use of, so the young generation will become a potential goal that this industry can focus on. In developing countries, specifically in Vietnam, an anonymous vehicle is a controversial issue because the majority are low-tech workers. If people tend to use anonymous vehicles instead of Level 0 vehicles, low-tech drivers get in stuck with finding the old-fashioned customers. Also, their standard of living will be affected drastically, and unemployment will become an alert issue that the government has to deal with.
   </p>

<h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
<p>Honestly, I am so eager to see or experience fully automatic cars on the road. In comparison, I preferred to learn with a Manual Transmission Car (MT) to get a driving license which is a traditional method. But when I borrowed Automatic Transmission Car (AT) to practice more, I felt the new one is better and convenient for users. We do not hold on taper quite long when they go into a highway. Therefore, I believe that a Level 5 vehicle will bring dramatic drivers. Since most of the students who are provincialist live in Saigon, traffic congestion is an obsession in our student life. Hence, an anonymous vehicle is an efficient solution to avoid being held up in rush hours. In my opinion, it sounds not appropriate but I assume that a driverless car is safer for drinkers if they still ride their own car. Moreover, carbon footprint will decrease and we can protect either health care or the green world. In general, the benefit impresses lots of people is self-control fix due to software as a smartphone. Tesla had been noticed that a charger plug is a high-risk fire cause. To solve it, Tesla initiated a software update briefly and the problem could be resolved with distance solutions.
</p>
<br>
       <li><h3>- Robots:</h3></li>
        <h4> What does it do?</h4>
            <p>Currently, the field of robotics has been developed day by day at a very fast speed. Robots are mainly assigned for dirty, heavy, and dangerous jobs that humans can not take part in. Specifically, we have telerobots; these robots are given orders remotely by a human operator to work in a site far away from the controlling station where is very dangerous and inaccessible. Moreover, large-scale industrial jobs are also replacing human workers with robots as the work needs to be done faster and with fewer mistakes, and the price of installing these robots is much cheaper than paying salaries for human workers. Also, employers don't have to pay for accident fees or give a raise in salaries if there is automation in the industry. People have always dreamt of the future life with more automation, some inventions have been continuously introduced, such as the small robots which can automatically vacuum around the house (e.g. Roomba). Robots have also played an important part in other aspects of life, such as helping humans exploring better the surface of Mars or detecting any special astronomical signs in outer space. In the next 3 years, robotics will have reached a much higher level of achievement than it currently does. Scientists and programmers are aiming to continuously make evolutions of robots, bringing out the new best, and create a subsequent generation. New algorithms will be developed and applied for new functions, the developers will also put the robots into other problem-solving situations to track the changes and test other functions. Also, robots are made with the aim of utilization, the more the robots are improved, the more convenient humans' life would get. It may happen in the next 3 years that more inventions of the combination of AI and robots are brought into real life, that will be such a turning-point. The robots may have a better ability to understand and respond to humans' needs or interpret what humans mean in speech. We already have robots with AI, such as Alexa from Amazon, it listens well to the owner's questions and requests. Therefore, there are still flaws in Alexa that may be improved in the future. We also need to look into the solutions to automation in other aspects as well, such as translating and interpreting languages). There is automation in translating and interpreting, but it only works with basic speech or text, complicated ones are interpreted and translated wrong to other languages as the meaning is strongly based on the context, but machines and applications cannot read that. Imagine the future with better robots with well-developed functions, another page of knowledge may reveal, humans can learn more about other things which currently are still hidden and we can't explore. Furthermore, humans are working so hard to develop robots and bring our lives to a brighter and better future. For instance, Korea and Japan are paying much effort in developing human-like robots. They can be used for entertainment, or working as a guide in the bookstores, convenience stores, etc. Another example is the well-known unarmed robot named Ariel used in the military and defense of the US.</p>
        <h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
            <p>Many things in life have indeed been easier to be done that before, but many jobs have also been taken away from the market, many workers fall into unemployment. The economy is also affected because to put the robots into work, this costs a fortune, and as more and more employees are no longer employed, the national economy cannot grow quickly. That causes a huge impact on the population and the human resources, as the development of automation requires a higher level of education to be able to work with it. The most affected people will be workers who are doing low-paid jobs. Usually, those jobs are very simple but always need a fairly abundant human resource to complete as quickly as possible, such as packing goods in factories, or porters. Because of the new nature of jobs requiring more education levels, which many manual workers cannot meet, those people are fired. Although many traditional jobs are replaced and done by the robots, new careers are also available in the market for the young generations as they are taught and experience more of the new technologies, which allow them to be the future developers or the masters of the robots. On the other hand, the companies don't have to pay much for human employees as the machines have saved them much money. Since the development of technology is continuous, the innovations that are introduced into industries today will set the stage for the emergence of new industries in the future. As a result, the rejection and recruitment cycle will continue as it is happening, and the future jobs will also require more growth than it currently is.</p>
        <h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
            <p>In the future daily life, robots will make everything more convenient and easier to accomplish. There will be changes in many industries; human workers are going to be replaced with automatic machines, productivity, and working efficiency will reach such a high level with fewer errors. Difficult and dangerous jobs are easily done with the help of robots, and people are not going to suffer injuries. Furthermore, other aspects also positively affect if robots involve in our daily life. For example, translating and interpreting will be delivered easier than before, people don't have to spend much time to find or pay much money for personal translators and interpreters as all they need to do is just a mouse click away. In large scale industries, specifically warehouses, employers only need to pay for the automatic robots and their applying or maintaining fee. Other extra fees will also decrease as maintaining the machines does not cost as much as paying workers' salaries. Moreover, future work will contain higher requirements for employees to apply for jobs as most of the basic work is done by robots, and what is left is advanced works. In terms of family, automation helps members achieve different things easier. To be more specific, for parents, they don't have to do much housework as they used to as there is an automatic vacuuming robot. For infants, there are security cameras with alarms that will send signals to the parents' phones whether a problem occurs. This will help parents from worrying much about their kids' safety. Furthermore, automation can also make self-study less boring and easier to complete as we can specifically search for anything online.</p>
