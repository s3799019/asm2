         <h4>What does it do?</h4>
           <p>Arthur Lee Samuel who invented the term ‘Machine Learning’ defined machine learning as ‘a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed’ in IBM Journal of Research and Development in 1959. Machine learning is one field that develops the algorithm and technology to let the computer learn in AI(Artificial Intelligent) technology. It analyzes data exploiting algorithms, learns through the analysis, determines the correct answer, and predicts the future trend and changes based on the data of learning. Machine learning utilizes sophisticated algorithms to learn from a great quantity of big data. Its goal is not to put explicit guidelines to the software by coding directly but letting the computer identify and learn an operation performance method itself through a ton of data and algorithms. The thing that makes a machine learn and put the machine to work faster and longer instead of humans enables automation. Hence, Machine learning makes it more affordable and flexible.
           </p><p>There are  6 major fields (Manufacture, Finance, Medical, Marketing, Government, Transportation) that machine learning technology has been applied and could be applied.</p>
           <p><strong>Manufacture:</strong> In the manufacturing and production field, manufacturers collect an enormous amount of data from sensors in factories and IoT(Internet of Things), and it is ideal for machine learning. Computer vision and abnormality detection algorithms are utilized for quality control and machine learning algorithms are used from everything from preventative maintenance and demanding forecasting to new service provision.</p>
           <p><strong>Finance: </strong>Finance which a large amount of data and history records are provided is a suitable industry for machine learning. Machine learning algorithms are utilized in stock trading, loan approval, fraud detection, risk assessment and insurance acquisition. And it also can be used to provide daily consultation to customers and to coordinate portfolios based on the user’s goal.</p>
         <p><strong>Medical: </strong>Machine learning also can be used in the medical field. Machine learning algorithms can process more data and discover more patterns than research teams or doctors, regardless of the time invested. Thanks to wearable devices and sensors that enable real-time identification, the medical industry is becoming a huge stage for machine learning.</p>
         <p><strong>Marketing: </strong>Machine learning can be used for websites recommending products that buyers will like. Utilizing product recommendation and promotion by analyzing the search and purchase history of past purchasers’. Data usage to personalize the shopping experience is becoming a new future in the marketing industry.</p>
         <p><strong>Government: </strong>There are especially many opportunities to acquire insights through machine learning Because government departments in charge of public safety and agencies that provide public services have various data. For example, Machine learning can analyze sensor data to find ways to increase efficiency and reduce costs or to detect fraud and minimize identity theft.</p>
         <p><strong>Transportation: </strong>Even in the transportation industry, which should predict potential problems and deploy routes efficiently to increase profitability, the technology that analyzes data to find patterns and trends is emerging as a key technology. Hence, courier companies, public transportation services, and other transportation companies are using data analysis of machine learning as a critical analytical solution.</p> <p>Machine learning is one field of AI (Artificial Intelligence) and came up with the notion that early AI researchers established. In other words, one method to embody AI is machine learning. AI covers a wide range and in that range, and machine learning takes charge of forecasting. In addition, Data has a big portion of Machine learning technology. It determines the accuracy and performance of AI. Also, big data is a technology that processes large scale data and machine learning is one of the areas that can make good use of big data through finding correlations between the data. In addition, Its practicality is reinforced due to the appearance of deep learning.
         </p>
         <h4>What is the likely impact?</h4><p> Until the decades ago, machine learning had a very limited range in work that machines can replace. But as technology evolved into the 21st century, the range gradually expanded. The level of technological advance has risen immensely and the machine learned through machine learning threatens human jobs in recent years. One of the biggest possible changes that could be done is autonomous driving vehicles. As big data technologies have developed, the amount of data that can be collected has also grown. Based on the data machine learning algorithms will make capable decisions in real-time. The safety and trust of autonomous driving vehicles also increase. Unfortunately, however, it will certainly hit the transport and freight businesses. Besides autonomous driving vehicles, the technology as if curling robots and medical diagnostic systems mostly utilize machine learning as well. These automation technologies have a profound impact on transportation, sport, and medical fields and the industries I mentioned above like finance, manufacture, marketing, medical industry. These new developments are not generalized and pervasive so far but It has been progressing even right now.
         </p><p>Machine learning technology can increase the chances of losing a job but it does not mean that every job and work is supplanted by machine learning technology. It can be interpreted that every worker should have knowledge about machine learning. Many companies and institutions around the world are developing and researching to reduce costs by applying machine learning technology. The person who deals with and processes the data also becomes increasingly an important position in society because they have begun to make their major decisions based on data. Researching new data types of data, and studying how to use the data for jobs in different fields by using machine learning as a means is crucial. As a result, it seems that the data science field will be significantly important as time passes.</p>
         <h4>How will this affect you?</h4><p> Machine learning will have a direct impact on everyone who can be aware of it or not. The dark side of machine learning technology is that, as many jobs will disappear and be replaced, people will have more difficulty when they find the job. In contrast, however, the bright side is it can replace dangerous and reluctant jobs. For instance, robots utilizing machine learning will process hazardous tasks like nuclear waste disposal, bomb disposal quickly and accurately without any control that the human had to do.</p><p> Besides the job, convenience in daily life will be increased in most applications and programs we usually use. For example, recommendation services including advertisements in social media, friend recommendations, would be more precise and accurate. And digital personal assistants also will be smarter. It will handle the schedule, handle the simple tasks as a real assistant. In my case, I am very forgetful. I used to buy the same grocery or food that I already bought and exist at my home. In this case, a digital personal assistant using machine learning technology can automatically check my refrigerator or grocery pantry and order what I need. It enlarges usability.
         </p><p> Last but not least, It will contribute to the overall health care industry including medical image processing, risk analysis, diagnosis, new drug development, and so on. Patients can monitor their health without the help of a professional medical doctor. Waiting in the waiting room for medical treatment is no more required. It will highly increase the accuracy and precision of diagnosis and decrease the time and accidents. Machine learning technology will help a large number of old people and people with disabilities who are not easy to go to the hospital alone largely back up.</p>
