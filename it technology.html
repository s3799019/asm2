     <h2>IT Technologies</h2>
   <ul>
       <li>- Cybersecurity:
       <h4> What does it do? </h4>
       <p>The world is within the interior of a cybersecurity race. With threats from hackers and deceivers throughout the internet presenting an even bigger danger to business, society, and safeness than ever before in history. However, we tend to utilize advanced technologies to strengthen up online security and this is going to be crucial in the later years. </p>
       <p>The threat from cybercriminals is turning into more and more subtle, therefore security has to be able to adapt so as to stay up. As luck would have it, there are a variety of recent technological developments that have helped improve the arsenal at our disposal to confirm we have a tendency to win against cyber attackers. Here are the 5 key technological advancements that are presently doing the foremost to enhance the cybersecurity efforts.</p>
       <p><b>Blockchain</b>: Blockchain isn’t simply the underlying technology that runs Bitcoin. However, is additionally security equipment. The digital ledger permits for the secure sharing of data and identity authentication, while not putting the information in risks of getting exposed to outsiders. This is the reason why there are health services like the NHS within the UK are experimenting with blockchain as a way of keeping the patient’s information from harm and sharing it between facilities.</p>
       <p><b>Cloud technology</b>: Despite being convenient, cloud has been evidenced to be problematic. The amount of data that can be stored on a single cloud account is actually surprising but this also puts the user’s data into possible risks. Luckily, cloud security has created leaps and bounds in recent years, with developers guaranteeing that every data is well protected against hackers more than before. Cloud data consists of a set of policies, controls, procedures, and technologies that collaborate to protect cloud-based systems, data, and infrastructure. These security measures are aligned altogether to protect cloud data, support regulatory compliance and secure customers' privacy as well as setting authentication rules for individual users and devices. From authenticating access to filtering traffic, cloud security has proven to be exactly what businesses want.</p>
       <p><b>IoT technology</b>: One of the major flaws with early-release internet of things technology is that it is connected to multiple devices while missing a common security system. This has led people to have concerns towards home assistant devices such as Alexa could possibly be the gate opener for hackers to access their personal devices. Fortunately, the large corporations have taken notice of the issue and so, IoT software these days will likely have a cybersecurity infrastructure that can be shared with all devices inside a household.</p>
       <p><b>AI and machine learning</b>: Possibly the foremost development that has allowed the U.S. to remain ahead hackers is the advancement of AI and machine learning technology. This technology is capable of gathering data across the globe and use it to adapt to any new kinds of threat. As such, hardware and software packages are getting more intelligent
without the need of human input and are becoming progressively adept at pre-empting security threats and adapting as desired.</p>
       <p><b>Application security</b>: Before, applications on a device were only secured thanks to the device they were hosted on. Hackers quickly took interest in smartphone applications and so, the applications were like a tool for them to use and access the data on our phones. But a lot has changed in recent years, with security software now being an essential part of the app-building process. As such, many apps are now even more secure than the devices they are installed on.</p>
       <p>Not to mention there are 3 technologies that are going to define the next decade of cybersecurity which are: 5G networks and infrastructure convergence; Artificial intelligence; Biometrics. </p>
       <h4> What is the likely impact? </h4>
       <p> As our society grows more reliant on technology, so is the importance of cybersecurity. We may be improving our capabilities to fight against cyber threats with the aid of new technologies, but the hackers could also weaponize the new technologies and use them against us. For example: Artificial intelligence is a double-edged sword that can be used as a security solution or as a weapon by hackers. The AI capabilities used to point out and prevent cyberattacks can also be used by hackers to launch sophisticated cyberattacks in the form of complex and adaptive malware. Hackers can use AI themselves to check and refine their malware so that it can actually become AI-proof. AI-proof malware can be extremely destructive as it can learn from existing AI tools and develop more advanced attacks to penetrate traditional cybersecurity programs or even systems that are boosted by AI. Which means that these AI-Enhanced cyber threats are and will still be posing great threats toward modern organizations. I believe that whoever has their personal information archived on the internet could always become a target, no one is ever really safe as long as they are connected to the net because they will always be spied on and this proves that anyone that’s using the internet is always affected by the development of cybersecurity. Cybersecutiy has an enormous impact on the internet across the globe because it prevents your data being accessed by the anonymous, as well as protecting the documents, materials, any data in companies, etc…. I doubt cybersecurity would make  any current jobs or technologies because it’s a completely different working field, cybersecurity even has to rely and advance certain technologies to improve the protection of data/intel in organizations, governments, and individuals too. Instead, it would create more jobs such as: Cyber Security Engineer; Vulnerability Analyst/ Penetration Tester; Systems Engineer; Network Engineer/ Architect.</p>
       <h4> How will this affect you? </h4>
       <p> From my perspective, cybersecurity has always been affecting our lives starting with the most basic knowledge that is about valuing and protecting our personal information. The lack of awareness about cybersecurity measures is one of the main reasons why people get their accounts on social media hacked, or getting their sensitive information revealed on the internet. It is also the reason why so many organizations suffer data breaches. The shortage of knowledge leads to insecurities which means that there are many breaches, data exposure cases are caused by seemingly innocuous errors that even basic cyber-security training could help mitigate. From the way I see, as the world continues to advance, the same applies to common knowledge. Before there was no internet so there was no reason for cybersecurity to exist or become an essential part of humans’ daily lives. One thing I know for sure is that the technologies which are used in cybersecurity will get more advanced as cyber threats/attacks will be more malicious and sophisticated as time passes by. This means that in the later years there could possibly be even more verification steps and policies just to lessen any possible risks of your data getting accessed by hackers. My take on this is that I’d definitely feel annoyed if I have to go through this much of phases just to protect my personal information on my Google, social media, online game accounts, it is very time consuming and frustrating for me, and then once there are new policies that get applied to the verification steps it would take even more time. I am sure that a lot of people including my family members and my friends would have that feeling of annoyance if they ever have to pass through such a tedious process just to have their data protected. </p>
