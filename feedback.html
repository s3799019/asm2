<h2>Feedback</h2>
<h4><u> Trang: </u></h4>
<p>Tae - She is a proactive partner who works with enthusiasm and responsibility. Also, she is an organized teammate that every work should be done on time. I am sure she was under stress because of our late replies and disorganized schedules. But she puts in a lot of effort to get along with the others and reminds us to take responsibility for finishing our own parts efficiently.</p>
<p>Thinh - He is a little quiet, but good-temperature to communicate with. He is good at explaining some difficulties for me to understand the others’ ideas. He has experience in programming projects which helps us a lot in the Project Idea part. </p>
<p>Khanh - He is the most confident person in our group through my eyes. He is the only person I get stuck to interact with at the beginning. Because of my lack of IT knowledge, I felt it was difficult to find some ideas to share with him and I will contact the others to expose my thoughts. After working on the Project Idea part, my initial feeling changes that he is a kind person and is also has a great sense of humorous.</p>
<p>Myself - As I mentioned before, I prefer  a reconciliation to a conflict. I felt shy and unconfident a little bit, I tried my best to come up with entire conservations as well as interaction. Hence, I hope I can contribute to our group as much as possible. Sometimes I could not understand clearly what my teammates were saying, but I asked them many times and I looked for the Internet to acknowledge myself. </p>

<h4><u> Khanh: </u></h4>
<p>Trang - She is a quick thinker, she is the one who was able to combine the team members’ ideas for the project idea section and came up with a very nice project too. While Tae, Thinh and I were struggling with coming up with the project idea for that section. So we were all grateful that Trang managed to help us with it.</p>
<p>Tae - She may seem strict sometimes but I am sure that she was that one person who contributed the most in this project. She even single-handedly did the IT work section for the group and is always participating in every group discussion</p>
<p>Thinh -  Thinh also has the ability to come up with solutions when dealing with a problem fast, he has also helped us so much in the project idea section just like Trang. Thanks to him I was able to gather enough ideas from everyone to write the “Motivation and how does it work” part in the project idea section. Thinh is also the best person to look up for whenever any team mate had any questions for technical issues.  </p>
<p>Myself - I have participated in every group discussion for this project, and often communicated with everyone especially Thinh to help him catch up with what me and the others have discussed about. Although I have procrastinated a lot, I still managed to get my work done on time. </p>

<h4><u> Taehyeon: </u></h4>
<p>Trang - Her perception and ideas about the team project was really helpful because she is the only person who is not the IT major. Personally, I think the combination of knowledge and experience in various fields will bring good results. Hence, she gave the difference and novelty and sparkling ideas to the team.</p>
<p>Khanh - He was always enthusiastic about the group project and participated diligently. His prompt reply made the team project smooth. He is also good at relationship management so he adjusts well between the team members. His good communication skill enhances productivity. </p>
<p>Thinh - He has excellent ability to think with new ideas and organize them. He was the most technically knowledgeable person. Thanks to his IT related knowledge and experiences as if python, c, and arduino programming, initializing and establishing the project idea was much easier. </p>
<p>Myself - The assignment was a good chance to check my ability and identify my personal characteristics. I tried my best to complete the assignment as soon as possible, and encourage other teammates to finish their own part which was divided. I usually propose the plan and the whole process was a good experience for me.</p>

<h4><u> Thinh: </u></h4>
<p>Tae: She is a good leader, she has always focused on our Project and helped us determine which way to go. Her diligence in work helped us realize that we need to work hard together to not let her down because she put so much effort in this Project. Moreover, she has  good knowledge about her Project Idea, especially Arduino, which helps me work with that part easier. And finally, she always helps each group member whenever someone does not understand anything.</p>
<p>Khanh: The youngest member but may be the most ambitious and talkative person. He is quite good at English and giving out many ideas that I really did not expect. Moreover, he has always been diligent and helped me to catch up with the group whenever I did not understand anything. With a dream of being a game developer, I think Khanh is likely to achieve it very soon since he also has good knowledge about what he needs to do with his plan in the future.</p>
<p>Trang: Trang has always been easy going and hardworking. With her mentality, she always connects each group member together. I am impressed with her ability to give out many quality contents for our group project. In my opinion, she is a good thinker with a good mentality and creativity. And, she is the one who gave our group a name, which is literally the hardest part of this project.</p>
<p>Me: To be honest, I am not the most diligent member in this project. Through that, I have learned how to synergy well with other team members and experience how to work as a group. This project has helped me learn many basic skills of being a part of a group. With this project, I personally think that we can make it become true if there is any chance. To conclude, I am very glad that I teamed up with these three people because they helped me grow up.</p>
