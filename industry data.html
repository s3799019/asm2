  <h2>Industry Data</h2>
  <h3><i> a.What are the Job Titles for your group’s ideal jobs? How does each of these rank in terms of demand from employers? </i></h3>
  <li>-Designer:</li>
  <p> My quintessential job title is Graphic Design which ranked at top 2 at the Burning Glass Technologies Source in 2018. This is a reason why I chose Introduction to IT (Information Technology) as a GE (general election) course. Graduated with a degree in Fashion Enterprise combined with a little bit experience in IT (Information Technology) field, I am looking to work as a Graphic Designer or Freelancer. Fashionista is well-rounded hands-on experience that is not accomplished enough to catch up with potential opportunities.</p>
  <li>-Game developer:</li>
  <p>My ideal job title is game development engineer. I assume the reason for why the job is not in the list of the ranking of demands from employers is that game developer is not the job that was popular at that time(during 2017-2018). Not to mention the skills required to be a game developer are actually a lot including: Looking at the design specifications of video game designers; Writing code to turn the designer’s concepts into a playable game; Programming the game’s terrain and artificial intelligence for non-player characters within the game. </p>
  <Li>-Information Technology Specialists:</li>
  <p>My ideal job title is Information Technology Specialist. This position is not in the ranking of demand from employers. I presume the reason why Information Technology Specialist is not on the list is because technically information technology specialist is a higher position requiring at least 5 years of overall IT experience including development, active directory, network, security and so on.</p>
  <li>-Software Developer:</li>
  <p>My ideal job title is Software Development Engineer. This position is always in top 15 in the ranking of demand from employers, sometimes it is in top 5 too. The reason may be because the world is developing rapidly, therefore, people need more and more applications to progress easier in their life, and it is a necessary job to satisfy customers’ needs over time, especially in this IoT world.</p>

  <h3><i> b.From your group’s ideal jobs, you can identify a set of skills required for these jobs (we will refer to this as your group’s ​required skill set​). These can be divided into general skills​ (communication, problem-solving, writing etc) and​ IT-specific skills (Javascript, SQL, etc).</i></h3>

  <h4>1.How do the ​IT-specific skills​ in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h4>
  <li>-Designer</li>
  <li>-Game Developer</li>
  <ul>
      <li><b>SQL #1</b> (3570 postings) </li>
      <li><b>JavaScript #2</b> (2946 postings </li>
      <li><b>JAVA #3</b> (2860 postings) </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The required IT skills for game developers are all in the top 3. It is obvious that the required IT skills for one to be a game developer are pretty much anything that is related to the programming languages as game developers will be writing code for the designer’s concepts into a playable game.</p>
  <li>-Information Technology Specialists</li>
  <li>-Software Developer</li>
  <h4>2.How do the​ general skills​ in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h4>
  <li>-Designer:</li>
  <li>-Game developer:</li>

  <Li>-Information Technology Specialists:</li>
  <li>-Software Developer:</li>
  <ul>
      <li><b>Communication skills #1</b> (44,367 postings) </li>
      <li><b>Problem solving #2</b> (16,445 postings) </li>
      <li><b>  Teamwork/ Collaboration #5 </b> (14,364 postings) </li>
  </ul>
  <p>  Communication skills is always the key to success as it proves to be that one skill at the notable position in the demand from employers. As I will be working with other people in a group to plan and work together to achieve the goal communication skills, teamwork/collaboration are mandatory. Not to mention the ability to solve problems in efficient ways.</p>
