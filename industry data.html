  <h2>Industry Data</h2>
  <h3><i> a.What are the Job Titles for your group’s ideal jobs? How does each of these rank in terms of demand from employers? </i></h3>
  <li>-Designer:</li>
  <p> My quintessential job title is Graphic Design which ranked at top 2 at the Burning Glass Technologies Source in 2018. This is a reason why I chose Introduction to IT (Information Technology) as a GE (general election) course. Graduated with a degree in Fashion Enterprise combined with a little bit experience in IT (Information Technology) field, I am looking to work as a Graphic Designer or Freelancer. Fashionista is well-rounded hands-on experience that is not accomplished enough to catch up with potential opportunities.</p>
  <li>-Game developer:</li>
  <p>My ideal job title is game development engineer. I assume the reason for why the job is not in the list of the ranking of demands from employers is that game developer is not the job that was popular at that time(during 2017-2018). Not to mention the skills required to be a game developer are actually a lot including: Looking at the design specifications of video game designers; Writing code to turn the designer’s concepts into a playable game; Programming the game’s terrain and artificial intelligence for non-player characters within the game. </p>
  <Li>-Information Technology Specialists:</li>
  <p>My ideal job title is Information Technology Specialist. This position is not in the ranking of demand from employers. I presume the reason why Information Technology Specialist is not on the list is because technically information technology specialist is a higher position requiring at least 5 years of overall IT experience including development, active directory, network, security and so on.</p>
  <li>-Software Developer:</li>
  <p>My ideal job title is Software Development Engineer. This position is always in top 15 in the ranking of demand from employers, sometimes it is in top 5 too. The reason may be because the world is developing rapidly, therefore, people need more and more applications to progress easier in their life, and it is a necessary job to satisfy customers’ needs over time, especially in this IoT world.</p>

  <h3><i> b.From your group’s ideal jobs, you can identify a set of skills required for these jobs (we will refer to this as your group’s ​required skill set​). These can be divided into general skills​ (communication, problem-solving, writing etc) and​ IT-specific skills (Javascript, SQL, etc).</i></h3>

  <h4>1.How do the ​IT-specific skills​ in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h4>
  <li>-Designer:</li>
  <li>-Game Developer:</li>
  <ul>
      <li><b>SQL #1</b> (3570 postings) </li>
      <li><b>JavaScript #2</b> (2946 postings </li>
      <li><b>JAVA #3</b> (2860 postings) </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The required IT skills for game developers are all in the top 3. It is obvious that the required IT skills for one to be a game developer are pretty much anything that is related to the programming languages as game developers will be writing code for the designer’s concepts into a playable game.</p>
  <li>-Information Technology Specialists:</li>
  <li>-Software Developer:</li>
  <ul>
      <li><b>JAVA</b> (2860 postings)</li>
      <li><b>Software Engineering</b> (1372 postings)</li>
      <li><b>System Engineering</b>(1037 postings)</li>
      <p>This skill-set is not highly voted but in my opinion, a good software engineer must have a good knowledge of at least three of these. Moreover, not just JAVA should be learned, but other programming languages like C#, C++, Python should also be studied well to fully understand the code and the concepts around these job.
</p>
  </ul>
  <h4>2.How do the​ general skills​ in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h4>
  <li>-Designer:</li>
  <li>-Game developer:</li>

  <Li>-Information Technology Specialists:</li>
  <li>-Software Developer:</li>
  <ul>
      <li><b>Communication skills #1</b> (44,367 postings) </li>
      <li><b>Problem solving #2</b> (16,445 postings) </li>
      <li><b>  Teamwork/ Collaboration #5 </b> (14,364 postings) </li>
  </ul>
  <p>  Communication skills is always the key to success as it proves to be that one skill at the notable position in the demand from employers. As I will be working with other people in a group to plan and work together to achieve the goal communication skills, teamwork/collaboration are mandatory. Not to mention the ability to solve problems in efficient ways.</p>

  <h4>3.What are the three highest-ranked ​IT-specific skills​ which are not in your required skill set?</h4>
  <li>-Designer:</li>
  <li>-Game developer:</li>
  <ul>
       <li><b> Microsoft Windows #4 </b> (2,699)</li>
       <li><b> SAP #5 </b> (2,189)</li>
       <li><b> Business management #6 </b> (2,141)</li>
  <Li>-Information Technology Specialists:</li>
  <li>-Software Developer:
      <li><b>SQL</b>  (3570 postings)</li>
      <li><b>JavaScript </b>(2947 postings)</li>
      <li><b>Microsoft Windows</b> (2699 postings)</li>
  </li>

  <h4>4.What are the three highest-ranked ​general skills​ which are not in your required skill set?</h4>
  <li>-Designer:</li>
  <li>-Game developer:</li>
  <ul>
        <li><b>Organisational skills #3 </b> (15,844 postings) </li>
        <li><b>Writing #4 </b> (15,590 postings) </li>
        <Li><b>Detail oriented #8 </b> (8,298 postings) </li>

  <Li>-Information Technology Specialists:</li>
  <li>-Software Developer:
      <li><b>Problem Solving</b> (16445 postings)</li>
      <li><b>Organizational Skills</b> (15844 postings)</li>
      <li><b>Writing </b>(15590 postings)</li>

 <h3><i> c.Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not? </i></h3>
 <li>-Designer:</li>
 <p>Obviously my answer is no. As I mentioned so many times, I can not work in any position such as the highest top Title Job (Solutions Architect) or my teammates’ ideal jobs because it requests a lot of master bachelors. How can I apply to this position, if I graduate with a Fashion Enterprise Degree. Maybe other jobs have more chances to work either in international environments or high income, but it is not worth working with no passion and acknowledgement. If my major relates to IT (Information Technology) field for AI (Artificial Intelligence) era, I am willing to get study more IT field to improve my skills as well. </p>
 <li>-Game developer:</li>
 <p>No, I have always been interested in video games, and I want to work in the field, to be a part of the gaming industry, to bring my ideas and turn them into actual games that people can play and enjoy. Or it could be coming up with ideas to improve a certain game that I love to play and implement those ideas into that game. As long as it’s a job that’s related to video games I would never lose my interests, the only exception would be graphics designer though as I am not good with art but I am always willing to learn more about it if I have to.</p>
 <Li>-Information Technology Specialists:</li>
 <p>Yes, It was changed to the opinion that selecting a realistic demand job is better to find a job for new university graduates and people who are just starting out in a career than becoming an expert or specialist in one field. Becoming a specialist and expertise in one field refers to the meaning that they put more effort and passion in their work to obtain deep knowledge and experiences about certain fields than any other. They have a specialty. But the smaller the range of specialized fields, the more likely it will be difficult to find a job with a high salary due to lack of demand. Even experts in popular fields right now cannot be relieved. The job market environment changes rapidly these days, people can become unemployed at any time. In order to minimize the risk of lack of demand due to environmental changes, I suppose that a generalist who is knowledgeable in various fields is a desirable choice.</p>
 <li>-Software Developer:</li>
 <p>No, my ideal job still has not changed at all. This is my ideal job, so whatever the skills required that I do not have at the present time, I am willing to learn those skills to be able to do my ideal job. Although it may be very difficult to obtain all the skills I need, but challenges will just make me grow up and gain me more knowledge and experience. To conquer my dream, I think quitting by not testing my limits is not a good way to achieve it, therefore, I still want to be a software developer even there is a long and rough way to go.</p>
